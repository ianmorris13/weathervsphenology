## Now that that's done I shall explain why my project is so important...

Maybe it is or isn't I'm not to sure myself yet.

## Abstract

The California climate is currently under extreme stress due to constant drought and increasing average temperatures. I would like to focus on if precipitation and differing temperture gradiants affect the distribution of native plants vs the distribution of non-native plants. I hope to visualize and project the future of the effect climate chagne has on California's native plants.

## Planned Deliverables

I plan to end up with a website that can accurately visualize the data that I have aggregated from various weather. There will be a constant temperature and precipitation graphing, with the option to choose what region the graph is extracting from. Also, there will be options to filter between species, genus, native non-native, etc... different categories between all flowers and to compare said categories over the yers. This applet and website will be hosted on herkuapp.com, simlar to this website https://eitc-app.herokuapp.com/. 

In addition to the data visualizations, I hope to forecast the future of native species, though that may be tough due to the many many variables that comes with ecological models. If so, the website that I have configured will instead include more interactivity, such as the ability to 

Lastly, I will provide thorough written analysis on the data, explaining in my opinion on why this is important.

## Resources Required

I am going to use free to use open source data from scientific organizations. 

Global Biodiversity Information Facility-
Free and open access to biodiversity data
https://www.gbif.org/

NCDC's archive of global historical weather and climate data
https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/

Database of Citizen Scientist self-reported observations 
https://www.inaturalist.org/

UCNRS Weather Station Database
https://ucnrs.org/nrs-weather-station-database/

## Tools and Skills Required

I hope to become better at machine learning, database management, complex visualizations, website building, and modeling. These skills will help me greatly in this project and additionally further in my career.

Packages may include; Mesa, plotly, matplotlib, pandas, sqlite3, numpy, scikit-learn, seaborn, and anymore I might encounter.

## What You Will Learn

I hope to learn how to create attractive websites and present data in a format that's easily digestible. In addition, I hope to forcast the future of this interaction between weather and Californian plant species using machine learning, or provide an Agent Based Model with this data. Lastly, I hope this project will help better my self-teaching skills in my future with programming languages. 


## Risks

A risk that I may encounter stems from the fact that ecological systems are often super hard to predict due to their multifaceted data. There are many variables that go into the growth of an organism, meaning there are also many variables that I could possibly not even think of to include, as well as variables that I include that will make my data unnecessarily complicated. This will become especially apparent with any models or forecasts I may run, whether it be through regression or agent-based modeling.

## Ethics

All projects we undertake involve decisions about whose interests matter; which problems are important; and which tradeoffs are considered acceptable. Take some time to reflect on the potential impacts of your product on its users and the broader world. If you can see potential biases or harms from your work, describe some of the ways in which you will work to mitigate them. 

Now there may be some things that could possibly arise from this project like leading to exploitation of certain groups or leading others astray from the truth.

The ethics of this project seem straight foward. I can act like this is one hundred percent foolproof, and can only benefit those who desire to preserve the native plant ecology of California. But like everything in this world, things have biases and you tend to only see them a certain way. I could try to see the consequences of this project from a different point of view...

### Some thoughts that may question the ethics of my project:

- What is the possibility for someone looking at a website gets the wrong idea?
    -Maybe my data somehow strengthens another's thoughts against the concept of climate change? 
- Are my data sources ethical in the first place? 
    -Is my data complete and uniform in coverage? Are any geographic areas or groups of people (or organisms) underrepresented? 
- If I choose to use models, what is the cost of making errors in future forcasting?

## Tentative Timeline

There will be checkpoints for the project at approximately two-week intervals. With this in mind, please describe what you expect to achieve after two, four, and six weeks. At each stage, you should have “something that works.” For example, maybe in two weeks you’ll ready to demonstrate the data acquisition pipeline, in four weeks you’ll be able to demonstrate some data analysis, and in six weeks you’ll have your full machine learning pipeline set up. Please keep in mind that you’ll be asked to present at each of these checkpoints. Showing “something that works” will usually be necessary for full credit. The “something that works” idea is related to the common concept of “minimum viable products” in software development, and is visually illustrated here:

In two weeks, I hope to have clean data that is easy to interpret and is easy to combine between the two data sets. 
In four weeks, I hope to have my interactive plots' website ready in a shell state.
In six weeks, I hope to have thorough analysis on aboot my data and its implications. In addition I hope to have my website up with wonderful CSS and a nice, presentable theme.
