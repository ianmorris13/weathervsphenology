    <abstract>
        <para>Recent studies (2008–2021) have demonstrated the high importance of old cemeteries for the preservation of steppe ecosystems and red-listed steppe species. The flora of 13 old cemeteries of the Kherson Province includes 2104 occurrence of vascular plants. The study of the flora of 10 old cemeteries of Kherson Province (rural cemeteries) was conducted during 2008–2017 and 3 old cemeteries of city Kherson was during 2020-2021. The area of the old cemeteries of the Kherson Province varies from 0.43 ha to 10.45 ha. Total area of all old cemeteries is 51,2752 ha. 
In old cemeteries of the studied region, rare steppe species have survived, although steppe vegetation is preserved where there are fragments of virgin and unploughed steppes around the cemeteries, near old villages or cities.
The preservation of the natural vegetation cover in cemeteries is supported by the sacred status of cemeteries that are places where economic activities are not allowed. The results obtained emphasize the floristic specificity and value of old cemeteries. They could play an important role in steppe phytodiversity conservation, and give perspective for the future steppe restoration actions.</para>

                  <geographicDescription>Floristic research was carried out in 13 old cemeteries. According to the administrative and territorial division, the examined cemeteries are located in the Beryslav, Henichesk, Skadovsk and Kherson districts and city Kherson of Kherson Province. Kherson Province include to the Lower Dnipro region. The characteristic features of the natural conditions of the Lower Dnipro region are determined by its geographical location within the true steppe zone of the Eastern European plain. The climate of the Lower Dnipro as a steppe zone is continental and is characterized by a temperate-continental climate with mild snowless winters and hot dry summers. The main features of this climate are formed under the influence of general and local climate-forming factors. The surface of the territory is almost flat. There are no rivers.The floodplain of the Dnipro is densely cut by numerous straits and branches. Islands and lakes of various sizes and configurations are common. In the coastal strip of the Dnipro terrace-delta plain, coastal land, flooded by sea waters, spit and islands, estuaries and lagoon lakes are situated. There are more than 140 lakes in the Dnipro, some of which are called estuaries: White Lake, Bezmen, Deaf Estuary, Pigeon Estuary, Mud, Zburyiv Estuary, Kardashian Estuary, Burkut, Kokhansk, Oleshkiv Lakes and others.
Regarding the geobotanical zoning, the Lower Dnipro region is located in three districts of the Black Sea and Azov steppe sub-province of the Pontic steppe province of the steppe zone: Bug-Ingul district of grasses, grass meadows and vegetation of limestone outcrops, Lower Dnipro region of sand steppes, sands and reed beds, Dnipro-Azov district of grasses, wormwood-grass steppes and depression (pid – in Ukrainian) meadows.</geographicDescription>

                    <para>We have used Google Earth Pro and QGIS 3.16 Hannover to prepare mapping and spatial analysis of the Kherson Province. Old cemeteries was esstablished before 20th. We determined the date of the establishment of each cemetery indirectly - on the basis of the date of foundation of the nearby villages, when the expansion of natural habitats was continuous. We searched for the date of establishing the village in the literature and cartographic materials. We prepared the list of vascular plants, that was published. The study of each site was conducted at least 3 times during the growing season: spring, summer and autumn. The data were compiled  which contained the following additional information about each taxon: its occurrence (estimated according to a 3-point scale: 1 – sporadic, 2 – infrequent, 3 – common).</para>

          <abstract>
              <para>There is a lot of research that follows and maps bio-diversity and land-use changes using large data-sets and satellite data. In contrast, we evolved an approach, as a part of this multidisciplinary project, where we examined a smaller area, but over a longer time period, using  historical maps,historical statistics and reports, and material that is available today, including satellite data. Importantly, we conducted focus groups and interviews with people in the area today to get an oral history of changes to the landscape. Also, we walked the landscape to find signs of bio-diversity and land-use change. In this regard, we benefited from a multidisciplinary approach encompassing botany, historical geography, and physical geography. In other words, while our approach is only applicable to a smaller area, we produced rich material for telling a story on how land-use and bio-diversity have changed, and what the impacts have been, not least for the people  living in this area.    This approach was discussed in workshops, but it was mostly developed in the field, during two productive field work  trips to Ukraine in 2017 and 2018. Common field work was carried out in the village of Zmiivka (Gammelsvenskby), Kherson Oblast, with  important comparative visits to other villages in the area. Before going to the field, however, we did an exhaustive search for of historical maps in historical archives. We developed methods for digitization of these maps in low-tech environments. We then developed methods 
for geo-referencing these maps (i.e. giving these maps coordinates). In both cases our method development is potentially significant, as we are not aware of other research that has done this before in the wider region, based on 18th to mid 20th century cadastral maps. Moreover, these digitized, geo-referenced maps then became the basis of a historical database on land-use in different periods. While such maps are occasionally referred to in historical and political geographical work, our project showed that these maps can be an  important component in GIS-related landscape and environmental history research. This is a proof of concept and there is a large potential here to be tapped.</para>

                    <descriptorValue>The Pontic-Caspian grassland-steppe extends from Hungary in the west, across Ukraine and (European) Russia to Siberia and Northern Kazakhstan. Or rather “extended,” for today this region is more noted for its agriculture and the fertile black soils under the steppe grasses than the grassland eco-system that defined this area for millennia. Before European settlement, however, the steppe was a billowing landscape of tall grasses, wild flowers, forbs, and shrubs. There was of course human impact of the steppe before European settlement and pockets of settled agriculture – though how much human impact and how much settled agriculture remain open questions. In any case, the steppe has been a meeting point between pastoralists and imperial powers imposing agriculture for thousands of years. The last such power to impose agriculture, and the one to do it most successfully, was of course Slavic civilization in its various guises (Russian Imperial, Soviet) extending down from the north beginning roughly 300 years ago, and since then the history of the steppe is one of colonisation, reclamation, famine and war, agricultural intensification and irrigation, bringing us to the present period where, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the use of the steppe has been characterised, until the past several years, by de-intensification of land use, abandonment of agricultural fields, and the seeming return, as indicated in the quote above, of the steppe. 
The economic up-swing in the early and mid-2000s led investment firms from Moscow and Kyiv to Stockholm and New York to bet on the economic potential of largescale, rational and modern agriculture on the relatively “under-utilized” steppe, identified as one of the most promising areas where agricultural productivity can approach western norms. Yet even as large land acquisitions in the steppe area (in Russia and Ukraine) are a growing trend, there is also an emerging discussion about how to balance agriculture with protecting and restoring the steppe, promoting bio-diversity, and making sure that, as agriculture in the steppe re-intensifies and re-industrialises, it does not lead to environmental disaster. Here the words of the prominent environmental historian Donald Worster (1990, 1106) come to mind: “Whatever terrain the environmental historian chooses to investigate, he has to address the age-old predicament of how humankind can feed itself without degrading the primal source of life. Today as ever, that problem is the fundamental challenge in human ecology, and meeting it will require knowing the earth well – knowing its history and its limits.” 
Proposed research is the southern Ukrainian Oblast (region) of Kherson, where in the 1780s Swedes from Estonia were among the first Europeans to settle in the region following its conquest by Russia, cultivating what was in essence “virgin” steppe.</descriptorValue>

                    <para>The goal of this proposed research is to better understand land cover and land use change, historically and today, in the Eurasian steppe through interdisciplinary study that combines the social and natural science perspectives of a team of researchers from Sweden and
Ukraine. 
In achieving this goal, we aim to: (1) explore how the different research methodologies and knowledge-bases of the research team can enrich each other‟s understandings of the drivers of land use/land cover change; (2) use the results from investigating the southern Ukrainian landscape to generate hypotheses about the dynamics of land cover and land use change in, and the historical ecology of, the Eurasian steppe in general. This second aim would in turn inform a third aim, which is to (3) compliment climate modelling of the historical climate in the steppe, by grounding it in research based on expert local knowledge from the region. We aim also to (4) contribute to a discussion about equitable rural development and the preservation of the steppe, both in terms of nature protection and in terms of agro-ecology, i.e. better understanding how the impact of agriculture on the steppe ecosystem can be reduced by accommodating agriculture to the ecological and climatic conditions of the region. Finally, (5) our ambition is to establish a more long-term research agenda
about the steppe “before and now,” where a new generation of scholars from Swedish and Ukrainian universities can take this
work forward. 
The main study site of the proposed research is the southern Ukrainian Oblast (region) of Kherson, where in the 1780s Swedes from Estonia were among the first Europeans to settle in the region following its conquest by Russia, cultivating what was in essence “virgin” steppe.</para>
